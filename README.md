# Dictionary server

## Getting started

Make sure you have created a [Lexicala](https://www.lexicala.com/) account.

Then, all you need to do is:

```shell
export LEXICALA_USERNAME=<your_username>
./run.sh
Lexicala password:>
```

The application will prompt you for your Lexicala password.

The application runs on port 8080 by default (can be tweaked via `application.properties` or setting a `PORT` envvar).
